SIP PATH header support for Asterisk
====================================

This branch is based on Klaus Darillions work in
https://reviewboard.asterisk.org/r/991/

Issue in the bug tracker:
https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-16884

I've added
- Realtime support (not tested)
- Global flag support

Tested without realtime, it works as expected.

What is path header?
====================
Path is documented in RFC 3327. 

Since REGISTER requests can not support Record-Route/route an edge proxy that is separate from a registrar/location
server adds a Path: header to a SIP REGISTER request to indicate that requests to this contact should be routed
through a certain edge proxy. This is saved in the registration database and used for new requests to the
registred contact.

In Asterisk we save the Path in the AstDB and/or in the realtime database

Todo:
----
- Update LDAP schemas for realtime
