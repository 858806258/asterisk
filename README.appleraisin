AppleRaisin - Moving Astdb to realtime
--------------------------------------

This branch, based on Asterisk svn trunk, implements storage of AstDB in ARA, the realtime data object
manipulation abstraction something in Asterisk. The name "realtime" is getting more and more
non-descriptive for what ARA has become. With the addition of delete and store operations,
realtime fits very well for astdb.

Why?
----

There are a lot of applications and GUI's out there that makes heavy use of astdb. In order
to be able to have some sort of failover solution and provide scalability, astdb needs to
move to another engine than Berkeley DB v1 that uses one single file. The GUI I had in 
mind when working with this code was FreePBX from freepbx.org. 

Howto:
------

1. This branch requires realtime drivers with the store and delete methods implemented. 
   The regular asterisk-addons and Asterisk realtime drivers now implement this (in trunk).
   I don't know the state of other than odbc and mysql drivers in this regard.

2. Make sure you load the realtime driver before channel drivers and modules that use AstDb

3. Note that because astdb is part of the Asterisk core, we have a chicken-and-egg issue. The AstDB
   interface is initialized before any modules, so by default, astdb initializes to the
   Berkeley DB interface. For each call, astdb checks if there's a realtime family activated
   and switches as soon as this is available. If there's any code in-core using astdb
   in your Asterisk version this will be an issue. I haven't identified any such issues
   in the Digium distribution of Asterisk.

4. Create a database with this table or something similar for non-SQL realtime drivers.
   Configure this in the "astdb" family in extconfig.conf

	CREATE TABLE `astdb` (
  		`systemname` varchar(40) NOT NULL,
  		`family` varchar(256) NOT NULL,
  		`keyname` varchar(256) NOT NULL,
  		`value` varchar(1050) NOT NULL,
  		PRIMARY KEY  (`family`,`keyname`)
	) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;

5. Remember to set the systemname in asterisk.conf

6. If you want to access an astdb variable in another server, just query using the normal
   realtime or odbc functions.
