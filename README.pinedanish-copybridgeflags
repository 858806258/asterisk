Pinedanish - copybridgeflags
============================

If you dialout through the local channel with a "t" option on the last dial to a phone,
after the local channel disappears, the transfer option is gone and the callee can not
transfer any calls.

With this code, the bridge feature flags on the last call leg is saved to the channel.
At local masquerade, they're sent as a control frame "upwards" and applied to the
remaining bridge. This way, the callee will keep the rights to transfer even after
the local channels are gone.
