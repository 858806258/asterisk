Remote hold support for Asterisk
================================

Asterisk currently supports playing music on hold when the incoming call on a bridge
puts the call leg on hold. With the code in this branch, Asterisk will be able to
put the device on hold using SIP offer/answer. 

The configuration is available in the [general] section of sip.conf as well as
per device.

This work is funded by Inteno AB, Sweden.
