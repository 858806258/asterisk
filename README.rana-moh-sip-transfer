Rana-moh-SIP-transfer: Getting music on hold back
=================================================
When the caller puts the callee on hold and the callee transfers the call while hearing music-on-hold,
the music disappears and the new callee gets a silent call. Originally we thought it was a SIP transfer
problem, but it turned out to be a core PBX issue.

Problem:

A calls B.
B puts A on hold.
A gets music on hold.
A transfers B to C.
C answers call.
C doesn't get music on hold - just silence.

The moh status is not following the transfer.

To check
========
1. Blind transfers in SIP	- works ok
2. Attended transfers in SIP	- works ok
3. Transfers to a queue 	- doesn't work

---
BLIND Transfer

chan1 ->transferer to asterisk
chan2 ->asterisk to transferee
target -> new channel

Todo: Copy MOH status from chan1 to target.
Or after target is set up, check hold status on chan2 and take action on that
-------
Attended transfer

- Chan1 -> transferer to asterisk
- Chan2 -> asterisk to transferee
- target.chan1 Target channel
- target.chan2 channel bridged to target
- What's the name of the channel between transferer and asterisk bridged to target???
We're bridging chan2 to target.chan1

Implementation notes
====================

- Add hold state to channel structure
- Add musiconhold class set by channel initiator
- make all channels set this class
- After bridge set up, check hold state on bridged channel
- If it's locally on hold, send AST_CONTROL_HOLD to the channel with the musicclass from the bridged channel

(After brainstorm with Matt Jordan 2013-05-28)

Other channel drivers
=====================
- chan_dahdi:		Don't understand the hold functions...
- chan_iax2:
- chan_mgcp:
- chan_?
- chan_local 		No changes needed

Transfer to a queue
===================

When doing attended transfer to a queue we have

A calls or answers B
A puts B on hold, B gets music
A calls the queue - no bridge, music provided by app_queue
A transfers B to queue

B now doesn't get any music

As this is not a hold case we need to find a way to restart MOH on a channel
with the previous settings.
