Problem:

A calls B.
B puts A on hold.
A gets music on hold.
A transfers B to C.
C answers call.
C doesn't get music on hold - just silence.

The moh status is not following the transfer.

BLIND Transfer

chan1 ->transferer to asterisk
chan2 ->asterisk to transferee
target -> new channel

Todo: Copy MOH status from chan1 to target.
Or after target is set up, check hold status on chan2 and take action on that
-------
Attended transfer

- Chan1 -> transferer to asterisk
- Chan2 -> asterisk to transferee
- target.chan1 Target channel
- target.chan2 channel bridged to target
- What's the name of the channel between transferer and asterisk bridged to target???
We're bridging chan2 to target.chan1
