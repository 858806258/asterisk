; Conversion table additions for the translation between SIP hangup codes and ISDN cause codes
; ============================================================================================
; This table is used to convert a negative SIP response to an ISDN cause code, that is sent
; over the PBX call bridge to the calling party, or to convert a received ISDN hangup cause
; from the called party to a SIP response. Changes will not affect how Asterisk treats a SIP
; response, but how the other party reacts to it.
;
; For reference, check Asterisk source code include/asterisk/causes.h
; and channels/sip/sip2cause.c
;
; Note also that this translation is not used in all cases in the SIP implementation in Asterisk.
; Fixes are always welcome.
;
; !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! READ THIS SERIOUSLY !
; Note: By changing the default translation, you can seriously jeopardize your Asterisk server functionality.
;       Make sure you understand what you are doing, and that you are testing carefully.
;       In 99.99% of Asterisk installations, you will not need to add ANYTHING to this file.
