Project Pinana
==============
Project Pinana aims to add SUBSCRIBE and PUBLISH support for dialog-info SIP events. 

This means that 
 - extension states can be published to a SIP presense server.
 - hints can be based on states on URIs in a SIP presense server.


We divide development in multiple branches

 - pinana-publish-1.4 for PUBLISH support in Asterisk 1.4
 - pinana-publish-trunk for PUBLISH support in Asterisk trunk
 - pinana-subscribe-1.4 for SUBSCRIBE support in Asterisk 1.4
 - pinana-subscribe-trunk for SUBSCRIBE support in Asterisk trunk

Developers are oej and marquis42
This project is funded by Tele-Kompetanse in Oslo, Norway
