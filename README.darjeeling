Darjeeling-prack-11
-------------------

This branch will implement PRACK in the SIP stack of Asterisk.

PRACK stands for reliable unreliable provisional responses.

In SIP, the provisional responses are often sent over UDP, which means that they can
get lost. Some of them are retransmitted every minute (to get at least one through
once during a three minute period following RFC 3261). For some messages, it's 
important that they get through immediately. Like if you want to play a message to
the customer that his call will be cancelled due to lack of funds in his account.

PRACK adds a retransmit and ACK mechanism to the 1xx messages excluding 100 (since
it's transmitted hop-by-hop).

Configuration
=============
Add prack=yes in the [general] section of sip.conf or in device configurations. 
Asterisk will now add 100rel to the list of supported options. If the other device
supports PRACK Asterisk will activate it or support it if the other side
requires it.
There's currently no support for requiring PRACK in a call.


Technichal details
==================

If the INVITE contains
	Supported: 100rel

then the 1xx answer can add 
	Require: 100rel
	Rseq: 	42

The Rseq is the PRACK sequence number
The caller then needs to confirm the message with a new request, during the INVITE transaction
	PRACK
	RAck: 	42	<cseq #> <cseq method>

And the callee confirms this (and close the PRACK transaction) with a 200 OK.

If the PRACK is not received in time, the 1xx response will be retransmitted.
There can only be ONE outstanding PRACK, which makes it easier to integrate in the
Asterisk SIP stack that unfortunately lacks a transaction layer.

PRACK is documented in RFC 3262.

Retransmission works like the retransmission of responses to INVITE (like the 200 OK).
It starts with T1 and doubles for each retransmission. Unlike INVITE responses,
the retransmission timer does not cap at T2.

If retransmission times out, a 5xx message should terminate the INVITE transaction.


A PRACK received that does not match existing SIP_PVT is responded to with 481.

* When to stop?
---------------
From the RFC: 
"The UAS MAY send a final response to the initial request before having received PRACKs for all unacknowledged
reliable provisional responses, unless the final response is 2xx and any of the unacknowledged
reliable provisional responses contained a session description. In that case, it MUST NOT send a final response
until those provisional responses are acknowledged. If the UAS does send a final response when
reliable responses are still unacknowledged, it SHOULD NOT continue to retransmit the unacknowledged
reliable provisional responses, but it MUST be prepared to process PRACK requests for those outstanding
responses. A UAS MUST NOT send new reliable provisional responses (as opposed to retransmissions of
unacknowledged ones) after sending a final response to a request"

* Receive in order until final response
---------------------------------------
"Handling of subsequent reliable provisional responses for the same initial request follows the same rules
as above, with the following difference: reliable provisional responses are guaranteed to be in order. As a
result, if the UAC receives another reliable provisional response to the same request, and its RSeq value
is not one higher than the value of the sequence number, that response MUST NOT be acknowledged with a
PRACK, and MUST NOT be processed further by the UAC. An implementation MAY discard the response,
or MAY cache the response in the hopes of receiving the missing responses.
The UAC MAY acknowledge reliable provisional responses received after the final response or MAY discard
them."

* When do the call begin?
-------------------------
A corner case that I don't know if it's implemented: If we receive and INVITE without SDP, we MUST
add SDP offer to the reliable answer and the caller must add an SDP answer to the PRACK. This means 
that the session begins in the middle of the INVITE transaction.
"Once an answer has been sent or received, the UA SHOULD establish the session based on the parameters of
the offer and answer, even if the original INVITE itself has not been responded to." (section 5)

* Security
----------
"The PRACK request can be injected by attackers to force retransmissions of reliable provisional responses to
cease. As these responses can convey important information, PRACK messages SHOULD be authenticated
as any other request." (section 9)
